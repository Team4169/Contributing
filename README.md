# Contributing
Guidelines for contributing to Team 4169 repositories  

When contributing to Team 4169 repositories please try and follow these guidelines. 

#Code
Please try and write neat code. What does this mean?
##Naming
When naming variables and functions please try and name them based on what they do.  
**Good**: `xAxisSensitivity`, `turnOnRadio()`  
**Bad**: `baconIsTheBest`, `klsdjfsdklfdsjsdklf()`

##Spacing
Add blank lines in your code when it makes sense. A good rule of thumb for adding line breaks is to add a blank line when you start doing a new thing. For example you could be defining variables and then you start calling functions, add an empty line.

##Comments
Try and keep your comments short, and informative. No one wants to read a novel.

#Git
##Commits
Please write clear and short commit messages. These messages should describe very quickly what you have changed in a commit.  

If you are adding just one thing is a commit use a short sentence
```

```
However if you are adding more than one feature please use shorter messages
```
+XBoxController Y button, +Mecanum Wheels, -Omni Wheels
```
